**In the first type, I tried to implement a simple linear regression algorithm from scratch.I took any random examples as values of the dataframe.
After finding the variance and covariance  values, I calculated the slope and intercept of the best fit line.**


**Then I found out the residual error, regression error and total error to find the R-square value. The last step was to plot the best fit time.**

**This tutorial will be helpful for anyone who wants to know the maths intiution behind linear regression.**
