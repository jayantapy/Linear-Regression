**--> In the first type, I tried to implement a simple linear regression algorithm from scratch.I took a random set of values as my independent and dependent features and converted them to a dataframe.
After finding the variance and covariance  values, I calculated the slope and intercept of the best fit line.**


**Then I found out the residual error, regression error and total error to find the R-square value. The last step was to plot the best fit time.**

**This tutorial will be helpful for anyone who wants to know the maths intuition behind linear regression.**
 
 

**--> In the second type,I imported a dataset available in the internet and performed several exploratory data analysis steps such as replacing missing values, handling outliers,data visualization and model building.**

**After choosing my training and testing data,model building was done using LinearRegression model from scikit_learn.**
**The step by step explanation is given in code**.



## I would suggest to first try and understand the 1st type and then go for the 2nd type.
